CrashCourseC
============

'CrashCourseC' is voluntary course and project at the [Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts](https://www.hslu.ch).
The aim is to help students who potentially never used a programming language to get up and running quickly, and to learn as they go.
It should be motivating, it should be fun, and it should be a learning experience.

The course philosophy is:
* Peer-to-Peer: the course is delivered peer-to-peer, with voluntary tutors and teachers.
* Simple: no complicated tool setup needed: just an editor, a compiler and then run the program.
* Real: instead using a special teaching language, we use what they will use at the university anyway: ANSI-C.
* Practical: instead running things on the PC, students get a board for free they can use.
* Short: Sessions are interactive, and half an hour to one hour max.
* Motivating: labs are short, and there shall be a feeling of success after 10 to 15 minutes.
