Setup of FRDM-KL25Z Board:
- from the factory, the board comes with MSD bootloader. That works fine for programming the board with the bootloader.
  But for printf() output the PEMicro/Freescale CDC Serial Port driver is needed.
  The drivers are available from PEMicro (www.pemicro.com) or from an existing Kinetis Design Studio installation
  (C:\Freescale\KDS_1.1.1\pemicro). Run the PEDrivers_install.exe to install the drivers.
- Get the boards updated with the latest bootloader and debug app.
